1. Testing the entire messaging feature of an application would not be good for a unit test, as there are a lot of interacting components which would not pinpoint a potential problem.

2. Testing the max message length feature would be an appropiate job for a unit test because it is very specific and isolated. A test that ensures that the messaging application does not allow a user to have a message over 80 characters is ideal for a uint test.
